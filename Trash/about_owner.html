          When I was a computer science major at ASU, I never imagined that I would develop a passion for cleaning windows. Pursuing my degree was proving to be quite costly, and I struggled to find time for a full-time job due to my class schedule. As the pressure mounted, I began to lose interest in computer science and felt increasingly behind in my life.
          <br>
          One day, while at my aunt's house, my mom remarked that her windows looked like they hadn’t been cleaned in years. My aunt offered me $100 to clean them, and I accepted. To my surprise, I found that I was quite efficient at the task, and I completed the job in no time. This experience sparked an idea: I realized I could turn this service into something more. A couple of weeks later, I started my own window cleaning company.
          <br>
          Not only have I found joy in window cleaning, but I have also loved working with local business owners and building relationships within the community. It may sound silly, but this business has given me a sense of purpose and hope. I now see a path to earn money while completing my degree.
          <br>
          I pour my heart and soul into every job, and I hope you’ll consider me for your window cleaning
